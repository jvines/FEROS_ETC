# FEROS Exposure Time Calculator

This repository hosts a routine that calculates plots showing the exposure time necessary to attain different S/N ratios for stars with different magnitudes and different sky brightness.

The code makes use of:

- astropy
- scipy
- bokeh

ETC.py hosts the routine to calculate the S/N and to create interactive visualizations while utils.py hosts the functions used inside ETC.py

This code was used to create the visualization in [this post.](address)
